# Tira

This is a TINY version of the IBP reduction program [Kira](https://gitlab.com/kira-pyred/kira).

Tira is designed for a pedagogical purpose, therefore it implements only "basic" IBP reduction, i.e. it contains no advanced options or operations.
However, codes in Tira are detailed commented.

For practical purpose, try [Kira](https://gitlab.com/kira-pyred/kira).
